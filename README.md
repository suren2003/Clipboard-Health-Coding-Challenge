# Red Planet Staffing

Welcome to the red planet! At just over one million people as of the 2050 census, Martian settlements are flourishing. As the leading staffing marketplace on Mars, Red Planet connects workplaces with workers to fill shifts.

## Business context

Our primary customers are Martian workplaces. While they have full-time staff, they occasionally need short-term flexible staff to fill gaps in their operations (for example, when a worker is sick or on a vacation to the Moon).

When they need a worker, workplaces post a "shift" on our marketplace. Workers on our marketplace then claim these shifts and are assigned to them. Once assigned, workers perform the work at the shift's start time until it's end time, and are paid based on the hours worked.
